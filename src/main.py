issues:
Have the connection established, but went to 404 page. So exception happens

(1). Have some metrics to see which ip works, which didn't workã€‚
(2). For those returning None, store the page source. To see if it is returning empty data or just not fetching correctly.
(3). Data storage problem. File writing/creating/reading.
(4). Is there any reliable fake IP address
(5). Multi-threading.
